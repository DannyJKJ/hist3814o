I felt some frustration during Exercise 2 when I simply misunderstood the instruction for #8.
      I thought I was supposed to open an already existing file within Nano that referred to today's date.
      In reality, I actually needed to simply create a title with the # sign, a title which incorporated the date in it, as well as add a short description of my intent.
