<p>I am simply trying to figure out exactly how DH Box works, and have been following all the instructions given in the Workbook to the best of my abilities. I got confused for this piece sepcifically (point no. 8), when I misundertood the intructions to be telling me to find an already existing file on this page. It was frustrating as a result when I could not.</p>
